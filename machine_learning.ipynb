    "Semi-supervised learning can be useful in scenarios where a large portion of the data is unlabeled. In this case, the algorithm can leverage the labeled data (fraudulent and legitimate transactions) to train the model and then use the unlabeled data to improve its overall performance.\n",
    "* 4.2 - Appropriate to use Semi - Supervised Learning\n",
    " Since only a small portion of the data is labeled, semi-supervised learning allows the model to use both labeled and unlabeled data to identify patterns and make predictions about customer satisfaction. This can be particularly beneficial when labeled data is limited.\n",
    "* 4.3 - Not Appropriate\n",
    "In this case, there is a significant amount of labeled data available for training a spam detection model. Supervised learning would be the more direct and efficient approach, as it leverages the labeled data to predict whether an email is spam or not.\n",
    "* 4.4 - Appropriate\n",
    "This is a classic supervised learning problem where the goal is to predict a specific outcome (probability of default) based on labeled training data (applicants with known default outcomes). Using supervised learning allows the model to learn from the labeled examples and make predictions on new, unseen data."
